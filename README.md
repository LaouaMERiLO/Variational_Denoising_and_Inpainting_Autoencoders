# Autoencoder Variants project

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of different types of autoencoders. We will delve into the intricacies of various autoencoder variants and their applications. The following types of autoencoders will be covered:

1. Denoising Autoencoders
2. Variational Autoencoders
3. Deblurring Autoencoders
4. Inpainting Autoencoders


## Key Features

- Image denoising and deblurring using autoencoders.
- Image inpainting using autoencoders to fill in missing parts.
- Latent space interpolation and exploration for variational autoencoders.
- Training with reconstruction loss and a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term.
